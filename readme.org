* Setup
After installation, you can set a default device by adding
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq kdeconnect-device "<device ID>")
#+END_SRC
to your =init.el= file.
Device IDs for available devices can be found by calling =M-x kdeconnect-list-devices=.
If you do not want a default device, you can set the active device for your session with =M-x kdeconnect-select-device.=
This function works even if you already set a default device.

* Usage
After selecting an active device, the following functions are available.

| kdeconnect-select-device | Select the active device from all available ones (you should call =kdeconnect-list-devices= first if you don't already know the ID of the desired device) |
| kdeconnect-send-file     | Send the selected file to the active device                                                                                                               |

* Troubleshooting
If you're not seeing any response from your desired device, make sure there is an active connection.
You can use =M-x kdeconnect-list-devices= or open up KDE Connect to make sure.
